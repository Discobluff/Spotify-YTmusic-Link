# Spotify-YTmusic-Link

## Description

A tool to link Spotify playlists to YouTube Music. When a new song is added to a YT Music playlist, it will be added to the linked Spotify playlist as well. This is useful for users who want to maintain their playlists across both platforms without having to manually update them. Only work in one direction (YT Music to Spotify) for now.
